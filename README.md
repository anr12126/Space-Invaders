## Features

* 🎮 Controller & Keyboard input support
* 🔊 Background music and sound effects
* 👾 Multiple alien enemies with increasing difficulty
* 💥 Laser collisions and explosions
* 📈 Dynamic difficulty scaling
* ⏸️ Pause menu with mouse interactivity
* 🔁 Start and Game Over screens

## Considerations
This is my first Pygame project wher I experimented with sound effects, GUI interfaces, and controller integration. There is plenty of room for code optimization and performace improvement, but I am very happy with the result and all the fun features I was able to incorperate.
